    title: Profile
    summary: |
      I'm a researcher, designer, engineer, journalist and musician interested in the intersection between AI, human-centered design, the reinvention of information access, and social progress as applied to a variety of spaces, including education, politics, law and healthcare. I also explore various approaches to human-machine collaboration in pursuit of generative art.

education:
    - degree: PhD in Computer Science
      university: McCormick, Northwestern University
      time: 2018 - Present
      details: |
        Currently a PhD Candidate in Prof. Kristian Hammond’s C3 Lab, with a research focus on the reinvention of the human-data interface through the synthesis of various modes of machine learning and symbolic representation for natural language processing, intent-driven data analysis, rich conversational system design, and mixed-modality response generation. Research project work includes:
          - __Northwestern Open Access to Court Records Initiative__: Leading the design and development of the SCALES platform, a core component of an NSF-backed joint initiative involving computer and data scientists, legal scholars, journalists and policy experts aimed at building an "AI powered data platform that makes the details of the federal judiciary and insights into how it works available and accessible to every single person." More details here. The core platform itself is being architected such that it can be leveraged in other domains and incorporate a wide variety of datasets.
          - __Mim__: Architecting and co-developing a rich conversational system aimed at question-answering by a process of question decomposition, sub-answer collection (culling candidate answers from a host of corpora, such as relevant APIs, open-source knowledge graphs, and encyclopedia articles) and evaluation, answer recombination (with relevant analysis), and response generation.
          - COVID Resource Map: Led the initial design and development and now collaborating on the expansion of a set of data acquisition pipelines for the collection, collation, and aggregation of various datasets related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including PPE resource shortages and surpluses at a per-hospital level, hospital bed availability, reported cases, reported deaths, unemployment data, proxies for consumer behavior, and a variety of others. Currently, a subset of the aggregated data is available for exploration via an interactive map at covid-resource-map.com.
          - The Advisor: Co-developing a conversational agent aimed at meaningful interactions with students around internships, job opportunities, class selections, and events. The system develops a profile of each individual through their searches and selections, aiding with suggestions and guidance as new opportunities or classes become available or the system discovers near-perfect matches that meet most of the student’s interests and criteria.
          - Pixie: Designed and developed a platform for the exploration of the latent space of GANs, as well as the creation of "human directed" music visualizations culled from those explorations. Currently pursuing a roadmap of feature additions.

    - degree: Masters of Science in Journalism
      university: Medill, Northwestern University
      time: 2009 - 2010
      details: |
        Earned an MSJ on a Knight Foundation scholarship aimed at bringing students with design and development skills and an interest or background in journalism to the Medill graduate program. While at Medill, graduate work included development of the American Visualizer, an app aimed at making census data accessible and useful to journalists through dynamic visualization; analysis of the media environment and impacts on the healthcare debate during 2009; and a FOIA-based research project associated with piecing together a timeline of events surrounding United 93 on 9/11.

    - degree: BA in Journalism and Media Studies
      university: St. Michael's College
      time: 2002 - 2006
      details: |
        While earning a BA, designed, built and maintained the first online student publication and hosted a weekly radio show on the college station.
experiences:
    - role: Director of Product Design
      time: 2016 - 2018
      company: Narrative Science, Chicago
      details: |
        Led a team focusing on the conceptual, architectural and UX design of a next-generation Natural Language Generation platform based on ontological modeling, data analytics and additional concepts leading to a host of awarded or pending patents (noted below).

    - role: Lead Product Designer
      time: 2014 - 2016
      company: Narrative Science, Chicago
      details: |
        Led the design of an end-to-end platform for fully configurable NLG, inclusive of data ingestion and analysis, chart design and rendering, document creation and styling, and delivery mechanisms for integration with a host of external platforms.

    - role: Software Engineer
      time: 2011 - 2014
      company: Narrative Science, Chicago
      details: |
        Co-defined and developed key components of a fully configurable, domain independent natural language generation system.
