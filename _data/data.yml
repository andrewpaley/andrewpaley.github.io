career-profile:
    title: Profile
    summary: |
      I'm an entrepreneur, engineer, designer, journalist and musician with a history of working and doing research at the intersection of AI, human-centered design, the reinvention of information access, and social progress as applied to a variety of spaces, including law, politics, and education. I've built and led teams at fast-growing startups, designed and defined applied AI systems that resulted in 25 patents at a company now acquired by Salesforce, and written and given talks about how to think about the future of AI-empowered UX. I also sometimes dabble in various approaches to human-machine collaboration in pursuit of generative art.

education:
    - degree: PhD in Computer Science
      university: McCormick, Northwestern University
      time: 2018 - 2022
      details: |
        ABD (currently on leave) on a PhD in Prof. Kristian Hammond's C3 Lab at Northwestern University, with a research focus on the reinvention of the human-data interface through the synthesis of various modes of machine learning and symbolic representation for natural language processing, intent-driven data analysis, rich conversational system design, and response generation. Research project work included:
          - __Natural Language Notebook Platform__: Leading the design and development of a platform aimed at empowering non-technical users with the toolset necessary to drive data search and analysis without needing to write code or database queries. The UX pulls from the scaffolding of Jupyter notebooks, but the interaction mechanics are based in natural language -- the "natural language notebook." And all analytics, query generators, API components and UX are abstracted away from the particulars of any given dataset, with new datasets being brought to the system through configuration.
          - __Northwestern Open Access to Court Records Initiative__: Leading the development of the SCALES platform (implemented as one instance of the Natural Language Notebook Platform), a core component of an NSF-backed joint initiative involving computer and data scientists, legal scholars, journalists and policy experts aimed at building an "AI powered data platform that makes the details of the federal judiciary and insights into how it works available and accessible to every single person." More details <a href="https://scales-okn.org" target="_blank">here</a>.
          - __Mim__: Co-architecting and leading the development of a rich conversational system aimed at question-answering by a process of question decomposition, sub-answer collection (culling candidate answers from a host of corpora, such as relevant APIs, open-source knowledge graphs, and encyclopedia articles) and evaluation, answer recombination (with relevant analysis), and response generation.
          - __COVID Resource Map__: Led the initial design and development of data acquisition pipelines for the collection, collation, and aggregation of various datasets related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including PPE resource shortages and surpluses at a per-hospital level, hospital bed availability, reported cases, reported deaths, unemployment data, proxies for consumer behavior, and a variety of others.
          - __The Advisor__: Co-designing/developing a conversational agent aimed at meaningful interactions with students around internships, job opportunities, class selections, and events. The system develops a profile of each individual through their searches and selections, aiding with suggestions and guidance as new opportunities or classes become available or the system discovers near-perfect matches that meet most of the student's interests and criteria.
          - __Pixie__: Designed and developed a platform for the exploration of the latent space of GANs, as well as the creation of "human directed" music visualizations culled from those explorations.

    - degree: MS in Computer Science
      university: McCormick, Northwestern University
      # time: 2010
      details: |
        Earned an MS in CS as a subcomponent of the PhD program.
